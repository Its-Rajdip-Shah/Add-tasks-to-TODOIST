# My python projects 

These projects mostly serve specific utility services that I need but can't find an already available service for. 

**todoist_add:** add multiple tasks to todoist with respectice project sections. Needed to quickly add all the assignment tasks in specific todoist section (week1, week2..., week13) with proper tags and priority. It reads a csv and uploads the tasks to todoist. 

**YTDOIT:** Get and copy the transcript of a video or a playist of videos and copy it all to my clipboard.
